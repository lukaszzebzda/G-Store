## General Information

The main goal of project was to create an online video game store. In the app, the user can create an account and then, after logging in, purchase any game that their budget allows. After purchasing each item, user will receive a confirmation of purchase via email. There is also a library where all the games purchased by the user are available. The second type of account is an account with the status of admin, which entitles the user to use the admin panel, which in turn allows the modification of products and categories. The project uses various technics like procedures and trigers from Oracle database, or xampp mail server.
